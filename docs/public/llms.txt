# bunWay

> Express-compatible web framework for Bun. Drop-in replacement with zero rewrites.

## What is bunWay?

bunWay is a web framework for Bun that uses the same API as Express.js. If you know Express, you know bunWay. No learning curve, just faster performance.

## Key Features

- Express-compatible API: Same `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `req`, `res`, `next` patterns
- Bun-native: Built specifically for Bun runtime, no Node.js polyfills
- Zero dependencies: No production dependencies
- Built-in middleware: Body parsing, CORS, cookies, sessions, static files, rate limiting
- TypeScript-first: Full type safety out of the box

## Installation

```bash
bun add bunway
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { bunway } from 'bunway'

const app = bunway()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello bunWay!' })
})

app.listen(3000)
```
